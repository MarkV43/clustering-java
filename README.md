# Clustering

---

This project is meant to teach us how to separate a given set of data into clusters,
meant for the addressing of satellites for different regions of Earth.

## Execution

To execute this code, you have to have `gradle` installed. To run it, run `gradle run --args='n m'`,
where `n` is the method number (1-3), and `m` is the number of regions (we recommend 10).
